# LinkedIn Post: Software Crafters Unconference Spring 2026

Quick summary of some important highlights from Software Crafters Unconference (last week).

## What stood out

- **Same game, new tools.** We're still optimizing for learning and managing complexity (Dave Farley's frame). The difference: we're adding prompt engineering and "herding" agents while keeping humans in the loop, and we're extending control beyond flow, data, and source code into knowledge and interaction. The "source of truth" is moving further from what we used to call source code. Either we shape that, or it shapes us.

- **Sessions that stuck.** Open space topics ranged from co-evolving practices with LLM-assisted coding, TDD nuances, and agentic AI (when agents write the code — what do we rethink?) to technical facilitation, hexagonal architecture, observability, and event sourcing. Plus real-people topics: what you want from your manager, neuro-spicy at work, mentoring without becoming the bottleneck, and celebrating wins.

- **Why unconferences still matter.** Low polish, high value. Learning and improving together in public — that's the craft community at its best.

If you were there, what would you add?

Quick highlights from Software Crafters Unconference: same goals (learning, managing complexity), new dimensions (prompt engineering, knowledge/interaction control, source of truth beyond source code). Sessions spanned LLM-assisted coding, TDD, agentic AI, facilitation, observability, and the human side — managers, mentoring, neuro-spicy at work. Low polish, high value. What would you add?
