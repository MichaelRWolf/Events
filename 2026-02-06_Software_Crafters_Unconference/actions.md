I hope you enjoyed the Software Crafters UnConference as much as I did.  As expected, I was surprised.  Oh, how I savor that oxymoron - it's the magic of Open Space!!

Your comment about XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX caught my attention, and I'd like to know more about it.

If you're up for a short call, I would value trading insights.

Karol,

Good to see you at Software Crafters UnConference.  I appreciated the perspective you brought to the sessions we shared.  Let's connect here on LinkedIn?  If you're up for it, I'd also enjoy a quick call some time to trade ideas.

James,

Thanks for the LinkedIn connection request.  I enjoyed meeting you, and especially that you and Woody didn't just talk about working together... you actualy presented together!  So many talks about how to work as a team are.... (wait for it)... presented by a single person (i.e. a non-team).

In your intro, I caught that you are on a team that is teaching folks to mob.  I'd love to hear about that you are interested in hopping on a short call some time.

Best,
Michael

Jessica — I enjoyed meeting you at Software Crafters Unconference and loved the energy/perspective you brought to our sessions. Let’s connect here. If you’re up for a short call, I’d love to trade ideas on how anthropomorphic + artificial intelligences can collaborate. —Michael

Ted,

Good to see you at the Software Crafters UnConference.

I really appreciated both sessions you led. Event Sourcing has come up 2–3 times for me since then:

- AI agent memory + scheduling (Steve Yegge’s beads / “Gas Town”)
- a student-essay AI-audit system (pretty cool... it replayed all the keystrokes of a Google Doc to observe work patterns - composition vs cut/paste)
- a product idea where Event Sourcing is already the cleanest fit

I’m looking for short training or contract work. If anyone comes to mind, I’d appreciate an introduction.

Best,
Michael

### LinkedIn Post

Ted Young

- TDD.  Nuances, not intro level or cargo-cult
- Event Soruceing - Architecture matters.  If you don't get this right, no amount of TDD, Prompt Engineering, or agent orchestration can compensate.

Jessica

- Likely has more important skills than my decades of software -- Manageing 8th grade classroom.  30 students.

Garrick - Agile Crumudgeon.

- Crumedgeon - I don't want to pay for an AI to parse "Please" and "Thank-you.  In fact, I want it to teach me how to treat it non-anthropomorphically".
- Agile - "Uncle.  I learned that I was not asking the right question."

Woody (and friend) - Avoided the common anti-pattern of "Solo presentation on how to work in teams" ;-)   In addition to sharing his wisdom of many years, mostly in simple terms (like respect each other, play nicely, share your toys), he modeled that it is helpful to work together by presenting as a team!  Simple, yet novel -- show, don't tell.

Alex - Keen observer of (software) culture over the years.  And how it relates to common and business culture.  It comes so quickly, you have to pay careful attention, else you'll miss the subtle points and the insightful connections.  Pointed at recent "xxx manifesto"?? by Grady Booch, Kent Beck, who else?

AI, AI, AI.  Aye, aye!  My, my.
