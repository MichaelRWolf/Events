Karol,

Good to see you at Software Crafters UnConference.  I appreciated the perspective you brought to the sessions we shared.  Let's connect here on LinkedIn?  If you're up for it, I'd also enjoy a quick call some time to trade ideas.

James,

Thanks for the LinkedIn connection request.  I enjoyed meeting you, and especially that you and Woody didn't just talk about working together... you actualy presented together!  So many talks about how to work as a team are.... (wait for it)... presented by a single person (i.e. a non-team).

In your intro, I caught that you are on a team that is teaching folks to mob.  I'd love to hear about that you are interested in hopping on a short call some time.

Best,
Michael

Ted,

Good to see you at the Software Crafters UnConference.

I really appreciated both sessions you led. Event Sourcing has come up 2–3 times for me since then:

- AI agent memory + scheduling (Steve Yegge’s beads / “Gas Town”)
- a student-essay AI-audit system (pretty cool... it replayed all the keystrokes of a Google Doc to observe work patterns - composition vs cut/paste)
- a product idea where Event Sourcing is already the cleanest fit

I’m looking for short training or contract work. If anyone comes to mind, I’d appreciate an introduction.

Best,
Michael

You had sooooo much material that resonated with me, that I'd like to continue the conversation.

Though I didn't get to stay long, your session about manager expectations caught my attention. How did it go for you?

Thanks for the LinkedIn connection.

Good to see you at Software Crafters UnConference.  Although we didn't get time to interact much, I remember your interest in AI interaction patterns.  I share it, both for Artificial and Anthropomorphic Intelligences.

Diana,

What did you learn at SC UnConference?  Did it change how you work or think?

Me?  Mostly I saw what I already know.  (I AM human, after all).  But I added some more depth to it -- Some basics are intact (decomposing to smaller pieces), but others are truly disruptive and unpredictable in a way that we haven't seen before, and can (mostly) not be prepared for.  I'm both excited about and fearful for it.  Maybe that's what alive feels like?!

I'm doing some follow-up to see if I can kick up some time-boxed chunks of work.  Did anyone you bump into feel like a match in that regard?

Best,
Michael

<happyDance>That's the magic of Open Space!<happyDance>

  

I loved what you shared at closing circle for Software Crafters UnConference. I've considered writing it up as a post-conference insight, but wanted to ask your permission first. In an attempt to be playful, I wanted to nominate you for the "Agile Crumedgeon" award as follows... but if you don't want that kind of attention, I could reframe it as evidence of "The Magic of Open Space -- Be prepared to be surprised".

Thoughts

If they were giving awards, I'd give Garrick the Agile Crumudgeon award, for embodying both parts:

- Crumedgeon part - I don't want to pay for an AI to parse "Please" and "Thank-you. In fact, I want it to teach me how to treat it non-anthropomorphically".
- Agilepart - "Uncle. I learned that I was not asking the right question."

Seriously, though, the magic here is being both critical of ideas until they are proven, and also open to new ideas.

I missed the beginning of your "Spicy" talk, but got a sense of the room. Did you get what you wanted from the session? Or a surprise?

I've been diagnosed with ADHD ever since before it only had 3 letters! And as I look back, there were some "spicy" moments in my life that are beginning to make some sense.

If you're up for a short call, I would value trading insights.

Great to see you at Software Crafters UnConference. Even better to be at the after-party! Thanks for the honesty and directness you bring to conversations!

## Woody Zuill & James Herr

Thanks to the 2 of you (yes, 2) for SHOW (not tell). It was great to have a session _about_ teams working together actually be facilitated by a team!  
  
We've gotten away from the days of "cowboy coders", but have not (yet!) advanced beyond the solo presenter. I'm starting to see teams do presentations, but it's rare.  
  
Thanks for modeling it.

## Quinton

``` text
Quinton, I saw you briefly at Software Crafters UnConference, but missed catching up in a hallway. I anways come away from these inspired with what the technology can do. But it's not a good place to learn what want it to do, or what they are willing to pay to have done.

If you're up for a short call, I'd value the opportunity to catch up with how your job search is going.

### LinkedIn Post

Ted Young

- TDD.  Nuances, not intro level or cargo-cult
- Event Soruceing - Architecture matters.  If you don't get this right, no amount of TDD, Prompt Engineering, or agent orchestration can compensate.

Jessica

- Likely has more important skills than my decades of software -- Manageing 8th grade classroom.  30 students.

Garrick - Agile Crumudgeon.

- Crumedgeon part - I don't want to pay for an AI to parse "Please" and "Thank-you.  In fact, I want it to teach me how to treat it non-anthropomorphically".
- Agilepart  - "Uncle.  I learned that I was not asking the right question."

Woody (and friend) - Avoided the common anti-pattern of "Solo presentation on how to work in teams" ;-)   In addition to sharing his wisdom of many years, mostly in simple terms (like respect each other, play nicely, share your toys), he modeled that it is helpful to work together by presenting as a team!  Simple, yet novel -- show, don't tell.

Alex - Keen observer of (software) culture over the years.  And how it relates to common and business culture.  It comes so quickly, you have to pay careful attention, else you'll miss the subtle points and the insightful connections.  Pointed at recent "xxx manifesto"?? by Grady Booch, Kent Beck, who else?

AI, AI, AI.  Aye, aye!  My, my.

- Optomize for learning -
- Manage complexity -
