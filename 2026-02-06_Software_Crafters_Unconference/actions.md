## LinkedIn Post

Ted Young

- TDD.  Nuances, not intro level or cargo-cult
- Event Soruceing - Architecture matters.  If you don't get this right, no amount of TDD, Prompt Engineering, or agent orchestration can compensate.

Jessica

- Likely has more important skills than my decades of software -- Manageing 8th grade classroom.  30 students.

Garrick - Agile Crumudgeon.  

- Crumedgeon - I don't want to pay for an AI to parse "Please" and "Thank-you.  In fact, I want it to teach me how to treat it non-anthropomorphically".
- Agile - "Uncle.  I learned that I was not asking the right question."

Woody (and friend) - Avoided the common anti-pattern of "Solo presentation on how to work in teams" ;-)   In addition to sharing his wisdom of many years, mostly in simple terms (like respect each other, play nicely, share your toys), he modeled that it is helpful to work together by presenting as a team!  Simple, yet novel -- show, don't tell.

Alex - Keen observer of (software) culture over the years.  And how it relates to common and business culture.  It comes so quickly, you have to pay careful attention, else you'll miss the subtle points and the insightful connections.  Pointed at recent "xxx manifesto"?? by Grady Booch, Kent Beck, who else?

AI, AI, AI.  Aye, aye!  My, my.

- Optomize for learning -
- Manage complexity -
