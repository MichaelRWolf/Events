# People (template)

## Rules of thumb

- Keep this file public-safe: names + public links only.
- If you need emails/phones/addresses, put them in a separate file named with `_private` (handling deferred).

## People I met

- Name — org/role — notes — public link

## People to follow up with

- Name — why — next step — public link
