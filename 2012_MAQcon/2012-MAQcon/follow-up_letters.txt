|>  Shawn,
|>  
|>  I'm changing tack, so to speak, regarding my employment, no longer interested in traveling so much but still interested in facilitating/leading software teams and working with product users.  
|>  
|>  I'm looking for positions as ScrumMaster, Product Owner, Sales support, or technical trainer -- basically a position that requires a mix of software development insight with group facilitation and motivation.
|>  
|>  Can you recommend some folks that may need such skills, or other folks who could make further introductions?  If so, please introduce us or send my contact information to them.

It was great to meet you at MAQcon, and learn that my
introduction to QASIG was helpful to you.  Thanks for letting me know
that it was helpful.  With that kind of interaction, it's all too
