If it's bumpy and your team is falling down, SPEED UP.  It works when going too slow on a bike.  It often does elsewhere, too. -- Sharon

Loopy (https://ncase.me/loopy/) a tool for thining in systems is based on the same control theory that governs oscellating circuits, ecosystems, and aircraft stability.  Positive feedback systems diverge.  Negative feedback systems converge.  The later occurs when a loop has an odd number of negative influencers.   Chris Lucian showed system of wolf introduction in Yellowstone.  We created one for software quality.

Getting a _good_ source of _bad_ code is difficult.  So is designing training exercises to simulate problems while focusing the student on desired learning without unnecessary distraction.  -- JitterTed.
