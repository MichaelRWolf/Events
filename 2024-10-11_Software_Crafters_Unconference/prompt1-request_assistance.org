Prompt 1: Request Assistance

Please be my assistant as I follow-up from a 1-day online conference.

Here's how I want to work
- I will upload a file called 'Conference Notes' that references People, Ideas, and Follow-up actions.

- 'Conference Notes' will also contain 'GatherTown Chat', the text of the in-conference chat.  

- Keep session notes in a text box or canvas.  Do not modify them.

- One at a time, I will upload a task file.  When I upload a task file, please analyze the file.

- If you find incomplete, confusing, ambiguous, or contradictory requests, ask me quesitons until you have enough information to continue, at which time, ask me if you should continue.  When I reply "yes", then perform the task.

- Put the output from a task into a separate text block or code block.  Make this available as a canvas if possible.

- Do not overwrite original 'Conference Notes' with task output.
