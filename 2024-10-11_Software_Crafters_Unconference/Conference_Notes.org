- [[id:2B2C1D88-59E7-4042-8C03-761266653735][Mike Clement]] - is a husband, father of four, and currently a Distinguished Software Engineer at Hunter Industries. Mike believes we work best when we are working together and that there are no best practices—only better and worse ones depending on the context. Some leading practices Mike is passionate about are Test Driven Development, Pair and Mob Programming, User Story Mapping, Domain Driven Design and Open Space Technology. Passionate about raising the bar of technical excellence in th software development community, Mike is a founder and organizer of Software Crafters Atlanta and the Lean+Agile Atlanta Unconference.
- [[id:36D07DA1-6C8C-47BC-A833-848A3F05BC2F][Ryan Robbins]] - is a Senior Consultant at Hylaine. When Ryan transitioned from teaching physics and web development to writing software professionally; Clean Code ideas, pair & mob programming, and Agile methods generally resonated strongly with his values and way of working. The Atlanta software development community has been an incredible asset for Ryan, giving him the opportunity to learn and present at meetups and Atlanta Code Camp, and he is looking forward to giving back by organizing this open space event. Ryan will also be coordinating “something fun” for everyone to do after the event.
- [[id:04C89550-05DC-43A2-A1FF-B04FF24CDDE1][Jon Turner]] - looks forward to a world where everyone involved in software development cares about the quality of their software and the value it provides. He is an advocate of test driven development, pair and mob programming, continuously integrating code changes, and continuously delivering value to customers. He has nearly 20 years of experience as a software developer. When he’s not developing software professionally, Jon spends time doing game and mobile development, working on a variety of robotics projects (while trying not to bring about the robot apocalypse), folding origami for friends and strangers, or spending time with his wife and three children.

Making it easier for the developers to safely deliver value to customers?
A catalyst for developer productivity?
Steve Kuo

How to get people collaborating? They are already. Find the opportunities of where it's happening and highlight the good. Craft a short experiment with feedback loops to try it. Like let's pair on one story this sprint or someone pairs with me 1 hour today on a story...
