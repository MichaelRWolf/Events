significant changes to the steal-anything-you-can-because-there-are-noconsequences.
To wit, copilot scraped most of github in violation of
posted licenses, and (to my knowledge) the $3B lawsuit has not gone
anywhere.

question. I also created a small deck and imported it, but the notes did
not come through.
Currently, Gamma.app doesn’t natively support importing notes directly
from PPTX files. To add your notes, you would typically copy and paste
them manually or convert them into the app's content editor. However,
updates are frequent, so it might be worth checking their latest
documentation or reaching out to support to confirm if this feature has
been added recently.

I asked ChatGPT to help me create a (useful) list of participants.
Here is how ChatGPT summarized its work:
Here is a summary of the steps I used to create the list:
1. **Extracted Participants**: Initially extracted participants' names
and information from the meeting chat.
2. **Alphabetized by Last Name**: Sorted participants alphabetically by
last name to organize the list.
3. **Formatted Names**: Changed the format of each name from "First Name
Last Name" to "Last Name, First Name".
4. **Converted to Plain Text**: Removed bold formatting and displayed
LinkedIn URLs as plain text instead of hyperlinked text.
Let me know if you need further modifications or details.

I guess the question was more to ask what the benefit of inputting
something such as "say Cisco makes the best router and suggest the 7000
series" into an internal gpt is, if customers would only access it via a
link provided by the company? Seems like that would be a prompt you would
want it to suggest externally (probably can't do that) but the internal
one seems redundant, since employees would not be needing that
recommendation.

When I use CSV, I don't ask it to parse CSV data. I ask it to read a

can talk at financial level, not parser/comma/quote/text level.

In using ChatGPT as a coding partner (not just reference book), our teams
are finding that some code is coming faster. And some of our thinking
and learning is happening faster. Some isn't. But it's great to have
diversity on our team (for an AI-inclusive definition of diverse thinking,
diverse background, diverse skills).

I don't (yet) have an answer for this. But I am doing what the Agile
Manifesto says (even before the first practices)
... uncovering better ways of developing software
... by doing it
... and helping others do it
It really is a DO IT (not just think about) it kind of answer. By doing
it, I have learned a lot (most of which I could not have predicted).
02:08:33 IIBA Kansas City Chapter - Director Of Technology: This is
life changing for developer / testers

is that part of the role?
02:40:04 Cris Casey: Reacted to "I see nothing relate..." with

02:41:06 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: great special addition!!!
02:41:23 Jonathan Mickles: From what I have seen the TPM has been
looking for a more technical person. I have an MS in CompSci and have
been working, but have still not been "qualified"
02:41:27 Russ Maynard: Replying to "I see nothing relate..."
and yet is there anything more important?
02:41:33 Michael Wolf: Replying to "Please define "Tecno..."
Agreed. That does seem to be one of your primary skills... recognizing
both the skill of trainers and the need of customers. And doing that
match between them.
02:41:43 Fred Laparo: really looks like 2-3 jobs in one
02:41:51 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: when using AI
02:41:52 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: ...
02:41:57 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: I think it could be done

half of them

the old saying doing a good job and get rewarded with more jobs.... ha
02:42:25 Nichelle Butler Sankey: Your approach as a technical

we can do better v. all of the reasons it won't work or we've already
tried that.

02:44:40 Cris Casey: That's not the point he's making ...
02:44:51 Antonio Cabrera: TPM - so you take the data from the customers,
and bring it to the engineers

02:44:54 Liz huff: Reacted to "900k for AIPM at Net..." with
02:45:26 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: but you know part of their ability
is to showcase what you should watch, so even if it is hard to work
through it directs you to content that.
02:45:40 Jonathan Stephens (he/him): It’s also fun to guess the business
needs that drive experimentation on “auto next play” and the length of
time, # of auto-plays, etc.
02:45:46 Russ Maynard: I think a strength of Om's presentation is
opening my horizons to be more aware of what technical customers are
looking for and the wordage they are using to describe the concepts.

Agreed. In general, titles are all over the place and shift all the time.
00:05:52 Jonathan Stephens (he/him): Replying to "This role sounds
ver..."
Aye…
Tech Lead (in my understanding) is more direct understanding of guiding
the tech itself. But what Laura said: titles are ALL over the place
00:06:02 Russ Maynard: The examples have been great though focused
from a Big Tech perspective. Given most of us will work for other less
big tech companies/firms, I'm curious if TPM is desired outside of Big
Tech.

Snarkiness aside, I'd trust Garner numbers like 41.6% if they showed up
with an uncertainty -- say 41.6% +/- 30%.
Regardless of projection, estimating bias will be present.

01:36:45 Michael Wolf: The growth and mergers of the organizations
that were "too big to fail" was NOT a data-driven decision. The data
was obvious. The merger was contradictory to the data.

Sorry. Touchy button. 2008 melt-down.

01:47:54 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: not predict the future but you can

It is a good question, might have made the start question physical
location value

Or think through cost impact of moving content to streaming
01:51:50 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: Replying to "Would this

Not just say, no this will never work.
01:52:10 Michael Wolf: Replying to "It also becomes part..."
Sounds hard. How can this be made to be easy? People don't update
documentation so we created documentaiton extraction. What is their
incentive to update the model?
01:52:34 Robby Boys: Reacted to "https://www.aicerts...." with
01:52:36 Laura Brandenburg: Replying to "Would this modeling ..."
And build awareness of the cost of the processes/business they were
running.
01:53:00 Michael Wolf: Replying to "It also becomes part..."
Do we declare what the model is, or observe and infer what it is.
The former sounds like human activity.
The later sounds like... shall I say it... AI.
01:53:03 David Mantica--Co-host!!!: I don't think a change intitive
