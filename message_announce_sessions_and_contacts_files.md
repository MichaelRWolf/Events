## Message v3

Hi,

I hope you enjoyed last week's Software Crafters Unconference as much as I did.

I've always loved these kinds of events because they are low-polish/high-value ways to learn and share.

First, I would like to **share** some data that `cursor agent` and I summarized and cleaned (into a git repo).

- [people.md](https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/people.md) cleans up  [Connection Information (miro...)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGEp6wkI=/?moveToWidget=3458764658684427373&cot=14)
- [sessions.md](https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/sessions.md)  cleans up [Marketplace (miro...)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGEp6wkI=/?moveToWidget=3458764602852762767&cot=14)

If you find these helpful, let me know.

Second, here's some of what I **learned**.

- **Nothing** is new... We are continuing to "inspect/adapt" in a field that is still new from a 100-year (and 3-year) perspective. Using Dave Farley's framework, we continue to
  1. Optimize for learning
  2. Manage complexity

- **Much** is new...
  - Learning - We must keep the old ways (oral tradition, social connection, books, Google, StackOverflow), and add new ones (Prompt engineering, herding cats (and agents) while keeping humans-in-the-loop).
  - Complexity - Old control points are still required (flow control, data control, source code control) as we evolve new dimensions to control -- loosely called knowledge control or interaction control.  The "source of truth" continues to get further from what we used to call "source code".  Either we will control it, or it will control us as we push the frontier between what can be automated and what can not (yet?) be.

Next?  More learning?

And if something from the unconference sparked ideas you’d like to explore further, I’m always happy to compare notes.

Best,

Ahhh.
Now we’re cooking.

You don’t want to say:

> “I use AI.”

You want to signal:

> “I integrate new tools the same way I’ve always integrated learning — in the open, with others, on real work.”

That’s strong. That’s identity-level positioning.

Here’s a version that carries that quietly.

**Subject:** SC Unconference notes + continuing the learning

Hi,

It was great to be part of the Software Crafters Unconference. Open spaces like that remind me why I’ve always loved this community — open source at its core is about learning and improving together in public.

Since you shared your contact info on the Miro board, I pulled together two structured summaries from the event so the conversations don’t disappear into screenshots:

• People
[https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/people.md](https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/people.md)

• Sessions
[https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/sessions.md](https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/sessions.md)

I used current AI tools to help organize and refine them — not as a gimmick, but as a continuation of how I’ve always worked: integrating new tools into real collaboration, in the open, while doing meaningful work.

If you’d like to stay connected, I’m here:

And if something from the unconference sparked ideas you’d like to explore further, I’m always happy to compare notes.

Best,
Michael

Why this works:

- It frames AI as evolution, not reinvention.
- It aligns AI with open-source values.
- It signals “I’ve been doing this a long time.”
- It avoids buzzwords like “AI consultant.”
- It feels authentic to your voice.

If you want it 5% tighter and slightly more punchy, I can compress it further without losing that signal.

Subject: SC Unconference notes + session list

Hi <name>,

Glad you attended the Software Crafters Unconference.

I’m reaching out because you left contact info on the Miro board.

As a small gift/offer: I practiced my AI skills and created two files you can use:

- People / contact info:
  https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/people.md

- Sessions:
  https://github.com/MichaelRWolf/Events/blob/main/2026-02-06_Software_Crafters_Unconference/sessions.md

Enjoy — I hope they’re helpful.

If you’d like, I’d love to connect on LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/MRWolf

Or I’m happy to set up a short conversation to explore ideas sparked by the conference.

Also (lightly): I’m looking for well-defined, time-bound engagements where I can help teams learn and improve together while working on their real production code.

Best,
Michael R. Wolf
