	Reviewing Feature Requirements
	
	
	Tip for Pre-Prompt: "You now have the role of a software tester and need to review the requirements
	according to ISTQB’s testing principles and SMART criteria. You will also ensure that the requirements are
	clearly understandable and not open to ambiguity. Read, understand and end with 'ok'."
	SMART:
	• S – Specific – Clear and precise
	• M – Measurable – Quantifiable and can be measured and achieved
	• A – Achievable – Realistic to achieve within time, cost, quality, and resources
	• R – Relevant – The goal should fit into the context of the project/task
	• T – Time-bound – There should be a clear timeframe to track progress against the deadline
	Prompt: "Review of this requirement and provide suggestions if SMART criteria are not met. In your
	response, you may comment on each point within SMART: [Insert requirement]"
