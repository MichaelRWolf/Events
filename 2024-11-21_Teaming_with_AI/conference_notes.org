** Note to Nitsan

It wasn't "inspiring", but I did generate some value by

1 - Observing Adam's facilitation style (and co-hosting style)
2 - Seeing how to stick to an agenda and time budget
3 - Some OK (but not "inspired") conversations (which confirmed that we are doing cutting edge work in the Sunday, Monday/Thursday groups).
