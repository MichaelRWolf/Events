## Goal
Create a Google My Maps visualization of first and second magnitude springs where the **greater of the two driving distances** (from New Orleans, LA and from Crystal River, FL) is **less than 225 miles**. Additional springs beyond this range may be explicitly included at discretion.

## Tasks
1. **Identify and list** all first and second magnitude springs meeting the distance criteria.
2. **Explicitly include any additional springs** that are relevant, even if beyond the 225-mile driving limit.
3. **Gather relevant data** for each spring:
   - Name
   - Address
   - Plus Code
   - Distance from New Orleans, LA
   - Distance from Crystal River, FL
   - Magnitude (First or Second)
   - Flow Rate (Million Gallons per Day)
   - Rollover Text (formatted as `Flow Rate MG/day (Magnitude), X miles from NOLA`)
4. **Format the data** into a table and save it as a CSV file for import into Google My Maps.
5. **Import the CSV into Google My Maps** and ensure:
   - Locations are correctly plotted.
   - A **water-themed icon** is used for all springs.
   - Springs are color-coded by magnitude:
     - **First Magnitude → Blue**
     - **Second Magnitude → Red**
   - The rollover text correctly displays `Flow Rate MG/day (Magnitude), X miles from NOLA` when hovering over a marker.
6. **Review and update as needed:**
   - If new springs are discovered that meet the criteria, append them to the dataset.
   - Adjust distances, magnitudes, and flow rates accordingly.
   - Generate and replace the existing CSV file with an updated version.
   - Re-import the CSV into Google My Maps and reapply styles.
