Goal:
-----
Follow up professionally with speakers and sponsors from a 1-day Generative AI conference as part of an active job search. Leverage the event to build connections and identify potential opportunities in the emerging field of GenAI, with a focus on not sounding needy but reestablishing income after a long layoff.

Tasks:
------
1. Extract and normalize the agenda into a structured table:
   - Columns: Session Number & Time, Presenter Name, Title

2. Extract people and companies mentioned in the notes:
   - For people: name, company, LinkedIn profile
   - For companies: name, website or LinkedIn profile

3. Create two canvases for reference and further development:
   - Agenda Table (session schedule)
   - Contacts Table (people + orgs with relevant metadata)

4. Annotate missing data (TODO list):
   - Identify which people are missing company info, LinkedIn, or company websites

5. Enrich contacts where possible:
   - Match names to companies and LinkedIn URLs
   - Add websites for known companies (e.g. Skills Development Group)

6. Maintain both canvases with updates from new file uploads

7. Provide support for follow-up strategy:
   - Optional: Draft outreach messages, prioritize contacts, track response status
